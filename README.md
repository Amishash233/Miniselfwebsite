# Miniselfwebsite
This is a minimalist personal portfolio website that serves as a gateway to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. It is built using Flask as the backend framework, with Python handling server-side logic. The frontend is developed using HTML and CSS, enabling a clean and responsive user interface.
